# Project 0

Web Programming with Python and JavaScript

This website showcases 2 of my passions, which is photography and music. 

This simple 4-page personal website was designed and built as a Project0 at CSCI S-33a Web Programming with Python and JavaScript Harvard University Extension School. 

During this project I used several technologies including HTML5, CSS, BootStrap, and SASS. 

The website consist of following pages: 

Home - includes 3 links 
  - Music
  - Photos
  - Contact
  
Music - includes YouTube video (via iframe). Also this pages is enriched with responsive nav bar, with a toggle/hamburger menu, which appears upond narrower screen. 

Photos - includes 6 squared photos with a width of 400px, which shrinks to 350px for the screen below 500px width (to fit a full image in mobile screens). Also images are aligned with col-lg-9 to fit 3 images per row. It give pleasurable rectengular look. 

Contact - inludes 4 input forms empowered by Bootstrap and CTA. All forms are responsive and mobil friendly.
